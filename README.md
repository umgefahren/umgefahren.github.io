_Hello_ from me. I'd rather stay anonymous here, but you propably won't have any issues finding out who I am.

#### What do I do

Like pretty much everyone on GitHub I write Code. My interests vary much, but they tend to concentrate in the image processing region. At least that's what I've published.

#### What tools I use

My favourite programming language is [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org), but sometimes I still use Python (it's not that big of a hassle as with Rust).

#### What work I'm proud of

My image compression algorithm is the largest and most complex peace of software I ever created. It took 3 days of coding to realize the silly idea I had. It's not as good as I hoped but I still believe in it's potential and I would like to invite *you* to come and contribute to this project.

##### Bye the way

I'm available for hiring. Please hit me up, although I should be busy graduating.
